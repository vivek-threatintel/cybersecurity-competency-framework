# Strategic Advice

Certifications should:

- Validate existing skill  
- Open hiring filters  
- Support career transition  

They should NOT replace hands-on expertise.

# Recommended Order (If Starting Fresh)

1. Security+  
2. OSCP or CySA+ (based on direction)  
3. Advanced specialization cert  
4. CISSP (once eligible)
