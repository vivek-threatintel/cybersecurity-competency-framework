# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Competency Framework

> A structured, research-driven roadmap for developing deep cybersecurity expertise — from foundational systems knowledge to advanced threat intelligence and adversary research.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This framework is designed to eliminate scattered learning and replace it with:

- Structured progression
- Technical depth over surface familiarity
- Offensive & defensive capability balance
- Research-oriented thinking
- Real-world application focus

Cybersecurity mastery is built in layers — not shortcuts.
